To leverage the greatest advantage from the CSM, it is useful to
utilize multipathing. This way, if one path has a fault, the other can
continue and data integrity is preserved.<br>
<br>
This section of the Bringup page will attempt to allow a person to
verify MPXio is installed and working properly on the Customer or lab
machine.<br>
<br>
Currently, the SAN Foundation Kit is experimental and under development.<br>
<br>
One can get the latest SFK here: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"

<br>
</a>Check for new SFK betas by browsing the directory here: <a

</a>Before installilng, it may be useful to refresh on some of the
conceptual foundational components installed by the SAN Foundation kit.
These include the <a href="leadville_stack.pdf">Leadville driver stack</a>
inplemented by the&nbsp; <a href="leadville_features.ps">Leadville
architecture</a> and finally the <a href="mpxio_toi.pdf">MPXio features</a>.<br>

SFK version 6.5.2 can be tricky.<br>
<br>
Once the tar file is obtained, untar it to a directory you have
created. Be aware of a certain patch called Q959651-02. On most
systems, running the installation script will return a code 24 whilst
choking on patch Q959651-02. One can use the patchadd program to try to
install the patch Q959651-02 manually. Invoking patchadd manually for
patch Q959651-02 will show it depends on another patch already
installed. Trying to remove that patch tells of another needing backing
out before. There are dependencies at least three levels deep.<br>
<br>
Typically, the "install_it" script is run and <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">if</span> it
runs to completion successfully, then the SFK stack is assumed to be <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">successfully installed</span>.
Note - at the end of the install, the install_it script attempts to run
patch_pro. Patch pro will install correctly, but will then identify
patches to install and fail at installing the suggested patches. This
may be due to the experimental nature of the SFK. In any event, when
the install_it script offers to install and run patch_pro, say no and
consider the installation successful.<br>
<br>
To see a sample install with a lot of problems with patch Q959651-02
and eventually installing successfully, please see <a
