Patchpro not installed. Starting installation of Patchpro.


This utility will install PatchPro and all required support
software. It is a wrapper around pkgadd and patchadd. It
will honor your SVR4 install policies and will backout all
changes if anything goes wrong.

Patches may be applied in support of the installation. For
that reason, this utility should be run on a quiet system
with no active windowing, preferrably in single user mode.
If reboot is required, you will see a message at the end of
the installation.

This installation will preserve critical data files by
executing a shell script with root permission.
