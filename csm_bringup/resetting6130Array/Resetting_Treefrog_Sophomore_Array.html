<div style="text-align: left;">To reset the array's configuration to
default, in lieu of relying on Storade support, there are two ways to
reset the array:<br>
<br>
1) Serial Port<br>
<br>
2) Ethernet connection and using Santricity.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
To use the serial port, it is neccesary to connect the array to a
serial terminal line.<br>
<br>
By far, the least painful way is to the lab's serial terminal network.
Serial terminal networks are evident in all labs in Nwk16.<br>
<br>
The serial terminal may be connected via the overhead patch panel in
the lab. The patch panel had blue jacks for ethernet on the top row.
The lower row has orange jacks and these are the ones to use for serial
connections.<br>
<br>
A yellow cable is used with RJ15 connectors on either end. Plug one end
into the RJ45 on the patch panel. Plug the other end into a RJ45 to DB9
conversion connector. Plug the DB9 connector into the DB9 serial
connector on the A controller of the array.<br>
<br>
To attach to the array's serial port when it is physically connected,
use a telent session from any Solaris or windows machine on SWAN.<br>
<br>
The telnet session is issued to a serial port server.<br>
<br>
The labs are setup with subnets. The patch panel where you connected
the yellow serial port cable will have a subnet number. From this
subnet number, one can derive the serial port server needed.<br>
<br>
If for example, you are in the 1730 marketing lab and you have attached
your yellow serial cable to the overhead rack,you may see a "55"
number. This means you are on ethernet subnet 55 and by convention,
terminal server 55 is also used.<br>
<br>
So, you would telnet to nts-55a xxxx<br>
<br>
Where xxxx is the port you are connected to<br>
<br>
For example, telnet nts-55a 2119 would attach one to <br>
<br>
To figure out what the xxxx number is, consult this handy diagram on
this link:<br>
<br>
http://webhome.ebay/nwses/Docs/NTS/Nwk16/index.html<br>
<br>
In the 1730 lab, say you attached to RJ45 jack #15 on panel EU5 of
Subnet #55. <br>
<br>
Consulting the chart, you see that indeed, you need to use xxxx = 2119
to access your array's controller.<br>
<br>
So, telnet nts-55a 2119 for this example. You will get to RJ45 jack #15
on panel EU5<br>
<br>
You make the telnet connection and the array appears dead? Why is this?<br>
<br>
The array's serial port needs trained. It will autobaud to a line rate
when provided with an ASCII break on the RS232 line. <br>
To make this happen you can use a special sequence in telnet..<br>
<br>
hold down control key and then press ]<br>
<br>
You get:<br>
<br>
telnet&gt;<br>
<br>
At the telnet&gt; type send brk<br>
<br>
example:<br>
<br>
telnet&gt; send brk<br>
<br>
You may need to do this 10 times or more.<br>
<br>
Eventually, the array gets it.<br>
You will see "Hit space to accept baud rate of 9600" or some such
verbage.<br>
You have 5 seconds to do this, so do it fast hit the SPACE.<br>
<br>
Now, send a break again..<br>
<br>
telnet&gt; send brk<br>
<br>
Now, quickly hit the escape key..<br>
<br>
The array will want a password<br>
<br>
it is: infiniti<br>
<br>
Congratulations! You are IN.<br>
<br>
To turn the array back to factory settings type in this destructive
command<br>
<br>
sysWipeZero<br>
<br>
After this command&nbsp; is issued, the system may lose contact with
the serial port as the baud rate may revert to a higher speed.<br>
Any network connections will be lost. Any customized settings are lost,
the IP addressing will return to first searching for BOOTP and then if
no BOOTP server, will go to static IP<br>
<br>
One will have to go through the baud rate setting procedure above to
regain serial communications with the array.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Step 2 for resetting the array using Santricity.<br>
<br>
One can install Santricity from this link:<br>
<br>
http://unibrick/fw/2882/Yuma-1/8-4-04/solaris_Rev_8.zip<br>
<br>
The username is broken<br>
the password is glass<br>
<br>
Save the .Z fiie onto the server you wish to use as a management server.<br>
<br>
Once the file is installed:<br>
<br>
unzip it like this:<br>

<br>
<br>
It will decompress into packages installable by the pkgadd command. You
must be root to perform these commands and to run Santricity.<br>
<br>
Install these packages as shown:<br>
<br>
pkgadd -d ./SMruntime-SOL-09.10.00.02.pkg <br>
<br>
pkgadd -d ./SMclient-SOL-99.10.G0.30.pkg<br>
<br>
If you don't have an IP address set for the array and you DO have a
fibre channel connection to the array AND you have<br>
the SIG build 9, Build 10 or Build 11 driver stack on the machine, then
you can use in-band to allow Santricity<br>
to communicate with the machine and reset it.<br>
<br>
For inband to work, install the Agent:<br>
<br>
pkgadd -d ./SMagent-SOL-99.10.00.07.pkg<br>
<br>
Now, you are ready to run Santricity.<br>
<br>
If you know the IP of the array, you will use the IP address to
communicate with it.<br>
If the IP address of the array is unknown, then you can use inband
management to connect to the array and reset the configuration.<br>
For both of these methods, Santricity is used. <br>
<br>
For inband - ie you forgot or lost the IP address or the array is not
connected to a network, you must have the Agent<br>
installed as above and a fibre channel card in the computer you are
managing from and a physical fibre channel connection to the array from
the HBA in the management computer.<br>
<br>
Before running Santricity, assure that:<br>
<br>
a) xhost +&nbsp;&nbsp; has been issued on the display you are wishing
to use to manage the array.<br>
b) setenv DISPLAY a.b.c.d:0.0&nbsp; where a.b.c.d is the IP address of
the display machine. This is usually not neccessary if using telnet.<br>
<br>
To test it first, try typing the command "oclock" and see if the llittle<br>
<br>
To run Santricity:<br>
<br>
cd to /opt/SM9/client<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
./SMclient<br>
<br>
When Santricity comes up, you'll see s small splash screen.<br>
Then, you will either see an array or a number or arrays or nothing.<br>
<br>
From this point, you can autodiscover arrays on your same subnet,<br>
(ie all 6130's in the marketing lab on the 10.4.55.x subnet).<br>
Or, you can add an array manually, by typing in the IP addresses of the
A and B controllers respectively.<br>
<br>
Select the array to reset:<br>
<br>
<img src="shots/Screenshot-devmgr.dmv.MainScreen-1.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 795px; height: 550px;"><br>
<br>
<br>
The screen will open to the selected array specifics<br>
<br>
<img src="shots/Screenshot-devmgr.dmv.MainScreen-2.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 710px; height: 400px;"><br>
<br>
<br>
Use the Advanced drop down and find the reset option<br>
<br>
<img src="shots/Screenshot-devmgr.dmv.MainScreen-3.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 710px; height: 400px;"><br>
<br>
<br>
From Recovery drop<br>
down, select RESET.<br>
<br>
From RESET select CONFIGURATION<br>
<br>
A confirmation screen is presented:<br>
<br>
<img src="shots/Screenshot-devmgr.dmv.MainScreen-4.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 427px; height: 379px;"><br>
<br>
After this OK is pressed, the Santricity program will lose contact with
the array.<br>
<br>
From the Marketing 1730 lab,&nbsp; Santricity is installed on the
bigbang-25 server.<br>
<br>
Prepare your display by issuing 'xhost +' from a terminal window on
your Sunray or remote server.<br>
<br>
<br>
One can then telnet to bigbang-25 and log in as root.<br>
Then, cd to /opt/SM9/client<br>
and enter<br>
./SMclient<br>
<br>
If Santricity does not come up, try the clock debug trick by typing
oclock. If the round clock come up on your display, you are probably
good to go with Santricity.<br>
<br>
Santricity will come up on your display terminal.<br>
Care must be taken not to disrupt demos in progress. Any rebooting or
management of this server or any server in the 1730 Marketing lab must
be discussed with Allan Yen.<br>

<br>
Upgrading firmware.<br>
Note - Use Storade to update firmware whereever possible. There are
also procedures in SIG Builds 9, 10, 11 to provide similar
functionality as the instructions issued here for Santricity. As our
customers will NOT be using Santricity, it is always good to use the
tools we will be providing.<br>
<br>
The use of Santricity is a stop gap measure until the Sun tools are
ready.<br>
<br>
The firmware files end in .dlp and are packaged in the .zip
distribution with Santricity and also Nvsram files.<br>
<br>
Santricity is context sensitive to the extension of the file and will
present the correct files when guided into the proper directory
providing the firmware upgrade files.<br>
<br>
Here are sample files of interest:<br>

<br>
Browse to the area with the correct .dlp files for the firmware file
and for the NVSRAM file.<br>
It is a good idea to upgrade both in tandem. If they are not done
together, the array can act unpredictable after the upgrade.<br>

If Santricity does not come up, try the clock debug trick by typing
oclock. If the round clock come up on your display, you are probably
good to go with Santricity.<br>
<br>
Santricity will come up on your display terminal.<br>
Care must be taken not to disrupt demos in progress. Any rebooting or
management of this server or any server in the 1730 Marketing lab must
be discussed with Allan Yen.<br>

Upgrading firmware.<br>
Note - Use Storade to update firmware whereever possible. There are
also procedures in SIG Builds 9, 10, 11 to provide similar
functionality as the instructions issued here for Santricity. As our
customers will NOT be using Santricity, it is always good to use the
tools we will be providing.<br>
<br>
The use of Santricity is a stop gap measure until the Sun tools are
ready.<br>
<br>
The firmware files end in .dlp and are packaged in the .zip
distribution with Santricity and also Nvsram files.<br>
<br>
Santricity is context sensitive to the extension of the file and will
present the correct files when guided into the proper directory
providing the firmware upgrade files.<br>
<br>
Here are sample files of interest:<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp; inflating: N2882-610843-010.dlp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; inflating: SNAP_06100310.dlp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Not shown is DOWNLOAD then Controller Firmware resulting in this screen:<br>
<br>

<br>
Browse to the area with the correct .dlp files for the firmware file
and for the NVSRAM file.<br>
It is a good idea to upgrade both in tandem. If they are not done
together, the array can act unpredictable after the upgrade.<br>
<br>
Here is what a compatible firmware files looks like when we have
selected a directory with compatible firmware files in it:<br>
<br>
<img

<br>
Select the file under FILES and read what is contains under File
Information<br>
<br>
<img
 src="shots/Screenshot-devmgr.dmv.MainScreen-8.png"
 title="" alt="" style="width: 534px; height: 613px;"><br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the firmware file selected<br>
<br>
<img
 src="shots/Screenshot-devmgr.dmv.MainScreen-8a.png"
 title="" alt="" style="width: 534px; height: 613px;"><br>
<br>
Select the NVSRAM browser now:<br>
<br>
<img src="shots/Screenshot-devmgr.dmv.MainScreen-9.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 534px; height: 613px;"><br>
<br>
Select the NVSRAM file:<br>
<br>
<img src="shots/Screenshot-devmgr.dmv.MainScreen-9a.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 534px; height: 613px;"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the final result of the files selected and selecting OK will
begin the firmware upgrade process:<br>
<br>

Similar procedures are used to upgrade the Expansion tray firmware and
drive firmware.<br>
